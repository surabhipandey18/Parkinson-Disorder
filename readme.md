# Parkinson's Disease Detection using Voice Features 

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that detects Parkinson‚Äôs Disease (PD) based on biomedical voice measurements. Parkinson‚Äôs Disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily affects movement and speech. Since voice impairment is an early and prominent symptom of PD, analyzing vocal biomarkers offers a promising, non-invasive method for early detection.

## üß† Problem Statement

Parkinson's Disease is typically diagnosed through clinical evaluation, which is subjective and often delayed. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to build a classification model that can accurately predict whether a person has Parkinson‚Äôs based solely on voice recordings ‚Äî potentially enabling early diagnosis and remote screening.
